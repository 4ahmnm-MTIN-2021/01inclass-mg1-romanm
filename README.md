### Description
*Mission Escape is a simple 2D-game developed with Unity. In the game you are in the Ice Age, as the task was to develop a game based on this theme. The player has to flee as fast as possible because a collision is imminent. You slide over snow hills using an ice sheet. The goal is to collect as many blue diamonds as possible before time runs out. But beware: the red diamonds are bad. If you collect a red diamond you get -10 points. However, a blue diamond gives you 10 points.*
